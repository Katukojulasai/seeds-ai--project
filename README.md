High-Quality Seeds AI

Project Name: High-Quality Seeds AI â€“ Smart Seed Sorting System

Description:
High-Quality Seeds AI is an advanced agricultural technology project aimed at automating the process of seed quality assessment and sorting. The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze seeds based on size, color, shape, and texture. This enables farmers and seed producers to separate high-quality seeds from damaged or low-quality ones efficiently. By leveraging AI, the system ensures precision, reduces manual labor, minimizes human error, and increases the overall efficiency of seed selection.

The AI model can detect defects like cracks, discoloration, deformities, or fungal infections in seeds. It can also classify seeds into multiple categories, ensuring only the best seeds are used for planting, which enhances crop yield and agricultural productivity.

Your Role:
As the project lead and AI engineer, my responsibilities included:

Designing and training the seed classification model

Implementing image preprocessing techniques for accurate detection

Collecting and labeling seed image datasets for model training

Integrating AI predictions with a user-friendly interface for farmers

Conducting performance evaluation to ensure high accuracy and low error rate

Collaborating with agricultural experts to validate seed quality metrics

Algorithms Used:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For image-based seed classification

Support Vector Machines (SVM): For comparison and validation of seed quality classification

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Used for simple seed similarity detection

Data Augmentation Techniques: To increase dataset diversity and improve model robustness

Programming Languages and Technologies:

Python: For AI and ML implementation

TensorFlow / Keras: Deep learning framework for CNNs

OpenCV: Image preprocessing and computer vision tasks

NumPy & Pandas: Data manipulation and handling

Flask / Streamlit: To build a simple user interface for seed sorting
